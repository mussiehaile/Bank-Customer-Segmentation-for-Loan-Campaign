Banks often have marketing campaigns for their individual products. Therabank is 
an established bank that offers personal loans as a product. Most of Therabank's 
customers have deposits, which is a liability for the bank and not profitable. Loans are 
profitable for the bank. Therefore, getting more customers to opt for a personal loan 
makes the equation more profitable. The task at hand is to create customer segments 
to maximize the effectiveness of their personal loan campaign.
